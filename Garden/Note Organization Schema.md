# Templates
When creating a new note, first insert a template (cmd/ctrl + p -> insert template or bind a hotkey). If there isn't an apt template and you hand-modify one a few times, create a new template.
- For example, if you keep on making "people" notes, you could create a template that includes a "met" date etc. 
- Make sure things are clearly labeled so, if needed in the future, we can write a (short) script to reformat this metadata.
